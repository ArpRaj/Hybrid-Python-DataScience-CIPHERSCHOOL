Project Plan
Tasks:
1.	Data Collection:
o	Obtain the Mall Customers dataset from the source.
2.	Data Cleaning:
o	Cleanse the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Perform detailed analysis to understand customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and other relevant factors.
4.	Clustering:
o	Implement K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior.
5.	Visualization:
o	Use Matplotlib for visualizing clusters and patterns within Google Colab.
o	Develop interactive dashboards and visualizations using Power BI for comprehensive insights.
6.	Documentation:
o	Prepare documentation covering all stages of the project, including methodologies, findings, and recommendations.
Resources:
•	Personnel:
o	Myself
•	Tools:
o	Python (for data analysis and clustering)
o	Google Colab(for code development and EDA)
o	Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
o	Power BI (for interactive dashboard development)
Risks:
•	Data Quality Issues: Ensure data cleaning procedures are thorough to address inconsistencies.
•	Algorithm Performance: Monitor and optimize K-Means clustering for accurate segmentation.
•	Visualization Limitations: Address potential challenges in creating effective visualizations to communicate insights.
